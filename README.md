# Grand_Project_1

1 - Usage of HTML, CSS, JS for View interface and interactions with the bot.

2 - SQL which is actually the start of the learning process of our bot... pushing and popping data there.

3 - Excel files that are used as the main raw conversations we are going to have...

4 - python + java functionalities and all concepts + design and architectural patterns for logics of our bot

5 - Git + Maven: Git for giving updates and commitments. maven for actually insert these excel files to our logical system so it would work while interacting through web interface.

6 - MATLAB usage: using as graphical interface to catch errors and have sort of heatmap for where the most issues are coming from, very great for helping us detect and debug faster.

7 â€“ UML diagrams (Class, Structured, Sequence, and Dependency Diagrams), along with architectural viewpoints such as the Functional Viewpoint (represented using Component Diagramming) and the Deployment Viewpoint (represented using UML Deployment Diagramming), are used to demonstrate how all parts of the system work together.
